# HashingPasswordAnalysis
Computer Security Final Project where we built a Python hashing dictionary attack tool and used it to search common passwords and test how long it would take to crack a password.
Talked about the pros and cons of different hashing algorithms and why SHA-256 is the industry standard and ways it is still vulnerable.
